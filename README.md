# kastle-refactored
Refactored code of the original Bastl instruments Kastle synth firmware.


This is a refactored vesrion of the original firmware for the @bastl-instruments Kastle. I will also upload here my experiments with bastl kastle firmware.

Arduino and [AttinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore) were used in making this project.

## Description
- VCO1.5_Refactoring - refactored version of the original Kastle 1.5 VCO

## To be done
See .ino file comments.

- [ ] LFO code refactoring
- [ ] Further VCO code bugfixes, making it easier to develop custom synths
- [ ] Custom VCO firmwares refactoring, developing some of my own
- [ ] Custom PCB gerbers
- [ ] Probably a 3d-printed case

## Does it sound exactly the same?
Almost. I did not modify the synthesis code much, though for some reason this firmware does sound a tad bit different from the original one.
